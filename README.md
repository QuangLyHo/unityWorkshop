# Unity Game Development - Aerofighter Game

Project is a part of BMCC's Winter Mobile Gaming Development Workshop

## Overview

Created this project using Unity Engine and C#. The game was designed to introduce fundamental Unity concepts and game development techniques while applying essential programming skills.

Some key features include:

- Collision Detection: Used Unity's build-in collision system to handle interactions between the player, boundaries, and hazards.
- User Interface: Designed a basic UI with a score counter and start/restart buttons, providing players with essential feedback and control
